This presentation is about visualizing some findings in the International Standard Classification of Education dataset and its changes across the last few years. This system of classification documents the „Expenditures by educational institutions on students by country and educational sector in US dollars with converted purchasing power parity”. I have used the online available ISCE databases to understand some of the main characteristics of international trends. The dataset is standardized and maintanined by the UNESCO as a project of organizing information on education globally, however the entries are not representing all countries in the world and every year in the given time frame. The ISCED was designed in the early 70s, the first version known as ISCED 1976 being approved by the International Conference on Education (Geneva, 1975), the second major revision of this classification was done in 1997, I have used the data available from 1997.
